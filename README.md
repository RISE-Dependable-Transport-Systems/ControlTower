A ground control station based on [WayWise](https://github.com/RISE-Dependable-Transport-Systems/WayWise) and [MAVSDK](http://mavsdk.io/) that can control [PX4](https://px4.io/)-based drones and [WayWise](https://github.com/RISE-Dependable-Transport-Systems/WayWise)-based vehicles via MAVLINK.
ControlTower was initially developed during the [LASH FIRE](https://lashfire.eu/) EU project to investigate the use of drones for fire prevention on ships (public report to be published beginning of 2023).

MAVSDK commit 926b067 or newer is require for building, which will probably become MAVSDK 2.0. For the time being you need to build MAVSDK yourself or use the *.deb (Ubuntu 20.04) provided in the main folder of this repository.
