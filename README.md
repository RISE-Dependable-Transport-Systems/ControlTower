A ground control station based on [WayWise](https://github.com/RISE-Dependable-Transport-Systems/WayWise) and [MAVSDK](http://mavsdk.io/) that can control [PX4](https://px4.io/)-based drones and WayWise-based vehicles via MAVLINK.
ControlTower was initially developed during the [LASH FIRE](https://lashfire.eu/) EU project to investigate the use of drones for fire prevention on ships (public report follows beginning of 2023).
